Notes for Math 162A: Intro to Differential Geometry at UC Irvine (https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math162a/math162a.html)

Derived from several primary sources, particularly undergraduate differential geometry lecture material taught by Toby Bailey at Edinburgh University, 2000. Other sources include DoCarmo's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, O'Neill's Elementary Differential Geometry, Lecture notes by Chuu-Lian Terng for 162A, and notes on Frobenius Theorem and Surfaces by Richard Palais.
