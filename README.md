The notes are derived from several primary sources, most notably lecture notes from undergraduate differential geometry taught by Toby Bailey at Edinburgh University, 2000. Other sources include DoCarmo's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, O'Neill's Elementary Differential Geometry, Lecture notes by Chuu-Lian Terng for 162A and note on Frobenius Theorem and Surfaces by Richard Palais.
